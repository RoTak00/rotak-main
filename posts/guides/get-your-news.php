    <p>It's rather important to get your news from a trusted place. It's commonly known that most media pages and television channels are heavily paid by political parties to promote their own needs, as this is legal under a gray zone.

    <p>I have started to receive my news about Romania exclusively from two news sources, unless I am searching something specific: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Declic's news of the day. <a href = "https://www.declic.ro/" target = "_blank">Declic</a> is posting relevant news every tuesday and thursday. Declic is known to be a trusted NGO, whose main goal is to create and push forward relevant petitions that citizens can sign in order to create positive change in our society. <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHtI3g6wmhjhOSZlclkdZoPDd0TCZ-9wZ" target = "_blank"> Here is the relevant YouTube playlist.</a>  
        </li>
        <li><a href = "https://recorder.ro/" target = "_blank">Recorder's</a> daily news are posted every evening, from monday to friday. The YouTube series has gone through a series of changes to become a great source of information. In the context of the upcoming elections, the news also host a project called "Portret de Candidat" (Candidate Portrait) which describes the past activity of the politicians that are being proposed for the parliament, europarliament or for other positions in the state. Recorder is an extremely popular and relevant independent news source, that works as an NGO. Their news series can be found on their <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/@stirile_zilei_Recorder" target = "_blank">News YouTube Channel</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
            <li><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2GNA88XAfhrmRRfu0_PLE-EWczlkf2Bp" target = "_blank">Ce ne enerveazÄƒ</a> is a show created by Recorder that talks about the issues of the current political state in Romania, in an easy to ingest (but hard to digest) manner. It is presented in a rather satirical way, while still providing great knowledge and news about what is going on. I watch it with great enthusiasm.</li>
            <li><a href = "https://www.hotnews.ro/" target = "_blank">Hotnews</a> is a news and investigation platform that has proven to be of great trust, and lacks clickbait and irrelevant media.</li> 
            <li><a href = "https://www.g4media.ro/" target = "_blank">G4Media</a> is another news and investigation platform that has gained the public's trust. They are authors of many relevant investigations and news. </li>
