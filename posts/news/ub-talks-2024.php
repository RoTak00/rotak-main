The event involves registering by sending in an idea of a project to <a href = "mailto:UBtalks@unibuc.ro" target = "_blank">UBtalks@unibuc.ro</a> until the <strong> 19th of April</strong>. Then the selected participants will go through some online trainings, at the end of which the finalists will be selected.</p>
<p>The finalists will complete in a <b>presentation session</b>, where they will talk about their project in 10 minutes. Several companies are sponsoring the event, so big rewards are in play! </p>
