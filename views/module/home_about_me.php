    <h2> Studies </h2>
    <p>I have just returned from an Erasmus+ student exchange, where I studied <strong>Software
            Engineering</strong>
        at <strong>Instituto
            Superior Miguel Torga</strong> in Coimbra, Portugal. This exchange lasted until the end of
        January, when I
        returned to my home country, where I'm enrolled as a permanent student. <strong>The University of
            Bucharest </strong> offers a <strong>Computers
            and Information Technology </strong> specialization, where I'm currently enrolled as a second year
        student. My academic foundation was laid at the
        <strong>Liviu Rebreanu National College </strong> in Bistrița-Năsăud, Romania, where I graduated from a
        demanding
        mathematics-computer science program in 2022.
